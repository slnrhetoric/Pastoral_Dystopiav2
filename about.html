<p align="justify">Briony Maeve is a British artist currently residing in California as a Fellow at San Francisco Art Institute. Her transdisciplinary installations utilise a biopunk aesthetic alongside living media and the cultivation of flora in dystopian sustained systems. Her work investigates ideas of social ecology, as well as both conceptual and practical resistance to modern day ecofascism. By highlighting the overlaps of hegemonic and oppressive structures in society, Briony draws parallels between her interest in biopolitics and environmental health, and her emphasis on intersectionality and abolitionism. </p>
